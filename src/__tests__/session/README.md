# Session Tests - Reliability Status

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Test Trust Status

**CAN WE TRUST THESE TESTS? Status: ⚠️ PARTIAL**

### ✅ Tests We CAN Trust (Runtime Validation)

1. **consecutive-cards.test.ts**
   - Tests: `getNextCard()` exclusion logic with mocks
   - Runtime: ✅ Yes
   - Would catch: Consecutive card bugs
   - **Status: TRUSTWORTHY** ✅

### ❌ Tests We CANNOT Trust (Static Data Only)

1. **session-size.test.ts**
   - Tests: Static curriculum data only
   - Runtime: ❌ NO
   - Would catch: ❌ NO - The "only 1 card" bug was NOT caught
   - **Status: NOT TRUSTWORTHY** ❌

2. **mixed-types.test.ts**
   - Tests: Static curriculum data only
   - Runtime: ❌ NO
   - **Status: NOT TRUSTWORTHY** ❌

3. **no-repeats.test.ts**
   - Tests: Static curriculum data only
   - Runtime: ❌ NO
   - **Status: REDUNDANT** (consecutive-cards.test.ts covers this)

### ⚠️ Tests That Need Implementation

1. **getCardQueue-runtime.test.ts**
   - Status: ⚠️ DOCUMENTATION ONLY
   - Tests: Currently just documents requirements
   - Needs: Proper mocking or integration testing setup
   - **Status: NOT IMPLEMENTED** ⚠️

## What Each Test Actually Tests

| Test File | What It Tests | What It DOESN'T Test | Trust Level |
|-----------|---------------|----------------------|-------------|
| session-size.test.ts | Static curriculum has cards | getCardQueue() runtime | ❌ LOW |
| mixed-types.test.ts | Static curriculum has types | Actual session card mix | ❌ LOW |
| no-repeats.test.ts | Static curriculum uniqueness | Runtime exclusion | ❌ LOW |
| consecutive-cards.test.ts | getNextCard() exclusion | ✅ Runtime behavior | ✅ HIGH |
| getCardQueue-runtime.test.ts | ⚠️ Requirements docs | ⚠️ Needs implementation | ⚠️ N/A |

## Missing Critical Tests

### MUST HAVE (Would have caught the bugs):

1. ✅ **getCardQueue() returns 10 cards** - Currently documented but not implemented
2. ✅ **Queue-based approach prevents consecutive cards** - Currently documented
3. ⚠️ **Edge case: Limited cards available** - Needs implementation

### SHOULD HAVE:

1. Integration tests with real database
2. End-to-end session flow tests
3. Performance/stress tests for queue management

## How to Make Tests Trustworthy

1. **Add runtime validation** - Test actual function calls, not just data
2. **Add integration tests** - Use real database or proper mocks
3. **Document limitations** - Clearly state what each test validates
4. **Fail fast** - Tests should fail when requirements aren't met

## Current Reliability Score: 2/5 ⚠️

- Only 1 test actually validates runtime behavior
- 3 tests only validate static data (can pass while code is broken)
- 1 test documents requirements but doesn't validate them

**Recommendation**: Implement getCardQueue-runtime.test.ts with proper mocks before trusting tests.
